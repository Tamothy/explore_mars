            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Explore Mars is an interactive travel website that explores Nasa's historic missions to Mars. Here are some of the key features:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_Mars" target="_blank">Nasa's Mars Missions</a> - All of our travel locations are past missions Nasa has held, including Curiosity, Spirit, and Opportunity rover locations.</li>
              <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors" target="_blank">Tesla Powered and Five Star Safety</a> - Our travel planes are equipped with Tesla powered equipment including a 5-Star Safety rating.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasas-curiosity-rover-team-confirms-ancient-lakes-on-mars" target="_blank">Themed Destinations</a> - When choosing a destination to visit the vacation activites are themed according to the Mars mission discoveries. For instance, choosing our Curiosity Rover National Park will allow vacationers to learn how Curiosity discovered water on Mars, while providing water themed activities at the vacation spot, such as Water Harvesting and Space Surfing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Project background - </span>Our project background consisted of creatively thinking of an application that allowed users to choose Mars mission landmarks to visit.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">The challenge - </span>The challenge was to think of a travel application that distinguised from our competitors, as most of the travel applications consisted of traveling to other colonies. </li>
              <li><span class="bold">Project goals - </span>Our vision is to create an application that's functionally pleasing yet also engaging visually.</li>

            <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Functional approach - </span>We began the process by analyzing the functionality of the application, exploring low fidelity wireframes, noticing different generation groups, and analyzing our travel competitors.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Design approach - </span>We researched vintage Mars posters to obtain our color palette, making sure the feel of the application merges with the inspiration and exploration of the Mars missions.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Prototyping - </span>Prototyping is utilzed to portray high fidelity compositions, regularly checking that our functional and design approach are linked as a union.</li>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Our solution in approaching these challenges was to start as a vacation application. Functionally we added the necessary features in purchasing vacation tickets, similar to how airline tickets are purchased. Once established we moved forward deciding how we would differentiate from our competitors, in such that instead of traveling to different colonies on Mars the user would decide to travel to previous Mars missions held.</p>
            <p>We analyzed past Mars missions to decide how we would design our vacation destinations. For example, researching Curiosity's discovery of water played a critical role in developing a theme for Curiosity Rover National Park, providing some water vacation activies.</p>

                <h2>Solution (cont'd)</h2>
                <p>Once our functionality was extablished, we pushed towards a subjective approach, deciding the feel and look of our application.</p>
                <p>We analyzed vintage national park posters and futuristic Mars posters, implementing a color palette that provides the inspiration and exploration of past Mars missions while also maintaining the nostalgic vacation feel.
                <p>Nevertheless, the result is an application that distinguishes from our travel competitors, providing functionality of unique themed activities while maintaining an evocative experience that imitates the inspiration of Mars missions: a feeling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)" target="_blank" class="red_link">curiosity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover)" target="_blank" class="red_link">spirit</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_(rover)" target="_blank" class="red_link">opportunity</a>.
